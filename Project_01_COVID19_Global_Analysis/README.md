# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Analysis

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global COVID-19 data, aimed at uncovering trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries and time. This analysis helps understand the spread, peaks, and effectiveness of control measures taken globally.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand the worldwide spread of COVID-19.
- Identify trends, peaks, and flattening in cases over time.
- Compare country-wise statistics on confirmed, recovered, and death counts.
- Analyze mortality rates and growth rates.
- Derive insights from visualization for better storytelling.
