# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival factors, and correlations between socio-economic status and survival probability.
The dataset includes information such as passenger age, gender, class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

## 📌 Objective

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Explore demographic distribution (age, gender, class).
- Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Analyze key factors influencing survival, such as class, gender, and age.
- Visualize correlations and patterns to uncover insights about passenger survival.
